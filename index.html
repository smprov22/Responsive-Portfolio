Although I expect this to be very challenging, I think the reward of a new, fulfilling career will be well worth it in the long run. <br><br>I am originally from Minnesota and moved to Sacramento with my family in 1999.  I went to High School here and then, after a brief stint in Seattle to play college soccer, I went to CSU Monterey Bay for college.<br><br>Upon graduation, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in editing in the TV/Film industry. Although I did ok down there, I never made it as far as I wanted, and after having my daughter in 2017, my husband and I decided that living near family while my daughter is young is more important than working in the film industry.</p>
